              This project was part of the UX Research course of the
              Interdisciplinary Human-Centred Design Program at Algonquin
              College. Its primary goal was to apply research skills to explore
              the experiences of new Algonquin students in managing academic and
              personal tasks using multiple college calendars. To gather
              insights, we employed a mixed-method approach that included
              surveys and semi-structured interviews with students. Based on our
              findings, we developed recommendations to enhance the student
              experience. The project was conducted collaboratively by

      <!-- The problem -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">1.1 The Problem</h5>
      <p>
        The onboarding process plays a vital role in helping new students at
        Algonquin College transition smoothly, especially international
        students. Moving to a new country for education requires significant
        effort to balance personal life, academics, and work effectively.
        Because of that, having tools for time management is important which
        helps students plan and organize their duties more efficiently. 
        Algonquin College offers various calendars to help students track
        academic and campus events. However, new students may struggle to
        familiarize themselves with multiple college-provided calendars from the
        beginning. They may also find it overwhelming to identify and use the
        specific calendars they need from various sources, making it difficult
        to manage their responsibilities effectively.

      <!-- Goals and objectives -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">1.2 Goals and objectives</h5>
      <p>
        This study explores the issue by examining task planning habits,
        analyzing user experiences with multiple calendars, identifying pain
        points and barriers, and proposing solutions to improve students'
        satisfaction in using calendars to manage responsibilities. While our
        study highlights that international students face the most challenges,
        it also includes domestic students who encounter similar difficulties
        with the same tools. Thus, the study focuses on both domestic and
        international students who use college-provided calendars to organize
        their academic tasks and events. This study aims to answer the question:
        <i
          >"What experiences do new students at Algonquin College have when
          navigating and using multiple college-provided calendars to manage
          their academic activities, extracurricular engagements, social events,
          and personal tasks?"</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this question, the study seeks to achieve the following
        objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Objective 1:</b> Identify the method students use to manage
          schedules, their preferences, usage frequency, and awareness of
          college calendars.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Objective 2:</b> Explore student’s experiences with multiple
          calendars, including tool choices, challenges, and key features they
          rely on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Objective 3:</b> Assess student’s views on college calendars,
          focusing on difficulties, coping strategies, and suggestions for
          improvement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Design process -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">3. Findings and Recommendations</h3>
      <!-- Finding 1 -->
      <div>
        <p>
          <b
            >Finding 1: Students struggle with using multiple tools to manage
            their tasks and prefer an integrated platform.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Students struggle with managing tasks across multiple disconnected
          tools, leading to inefficiencies and missed academic deadlines or
          important events. The lack of integration between institutional
          platforms like Brightspace and personal calendars complicates
          organisation, while accessibility and compatibility issues—such as
          some calendars being easily accessible on mobile devices while others
          are not—add further challenges. To address this, students emphasize
          the need for a centralized, well-integrated system that simplifies
          scheduling and enhances usability, ultimately reducing friction and
          improving task management.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <b>Recommendation:</b> A centralized calendar system should be
          implemented to help students arrange their tasks and activities. This
          system should incorporate institutional tools together with personal
          calendars such as Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. Incorporating
          features such as real-time notifications, due date monitoring, and
          multi-device support can help greatly improve the effectiveness and
          efficiency of this calendar. Thus, by providing students with a single
          hub, they will be able to manage their time and tasks related to
          studies and personal life without the need to switch between different
          applications. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Finding 2 -->
      <div>

            their tasks effectively.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Students highly value platforms that enhance task management, with
          Pulse standing out for its “Upcoming” visual tracker, notifications,
          and reminders. These features simplify academic organization and
          improve productivity. Future solutions should incorporate these proven
          functionalities to better support students in managing their
          responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <b>Recommendation:</b> To boost student engagement and productivity,
          existing platforms or a future centralised system should integrate
          visual tools like task progress graphs, timeline views, and smart
          reminders. Adopting Pulse’s tracking features will streamline
          planning, making organization effortless and adaptable for all
          learners.

        </p>
        <p>
          Students juggle academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities,
          and social events, particularly international students integrating
          into Ottawa’s culture. Their scheduling approach prioritises
          flexibility, emphasising daily and weekly planning over long-term
          commitments. They manage tasks based on urgency, adapting to shifting
          academic and personal demands. To stay organised, students rely on
          multi-device tools that sync seamlessly across phones, tablets, and
          laptops. Moreover, the ability to personalise these tools to fit
          individual preferences allows students to balance academic and
          personal responsibilities more effectively, making scheduling a
          smoother and less stressful process.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <b>Recommendation:</b> College-provided calendars should be seamlessly
          synchronised across multiple devices, including phones, laptops, and
          tablets, ensuring easy access in various contexts such as on the bus
          or during class. Additionally, implementing features that allow for
          personalisation with a simple, intuitive adjustment process will
          enhance flexibility, enabling students to manage their time more
          efficiently and adapt to changing priorities with ease.

      <!-- Limitations -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">4. Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Although this study provides valuable insights into the experiences of
        Level 1 students using college-provided calendars, it has certain
        limitations that affect the overall impact of its findings. Firstly, the
        survey primarily gathered input from Level 1 international students,
        with only two out of ten participants being domestic students. That
        means the study does not include enough data from domestic students,
        whose experiences may differ considerably from those of their
        international peers. Additionally, the research did not include insights
        from subject matter experts (SMEs), which could have provided greater
        depth to the findings. Moreover, the data collected may be biased
        because the small sample size does not represent the broader student
        population. Participants may have responded based on personal
        preferences or immediate experiences, which might not accurately reflect
        the experiences of all students.

      <!-- Learnings -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">5. Learnings</h3>
      <p>
        This research study was my first experience conducting a full research
        process, and it was a valuable learning opportunity. I developed
        essential skills in creating a research plan and learned how to design
        interview protocols properly to generate useful insights. I also
        realised the importance of pilot interviews, as they help identify
        issues and refine the process before formal data collection. On top of
        that, I got hands-on experience with ResearchOps, including participant
        recruitment, interview scheduling, and data management, which are
