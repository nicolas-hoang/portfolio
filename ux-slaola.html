      <p>
        SLA/OLA is a feature of a B2B product called Merchant . From the
        business perspective, the feature can be generally understood as a
        method that helps the working progress more effectively, more details:
      </p>
      <p>
        • SLA (Level Service Agreement) is an agreement between Client
        (Merchant) and Service Provider, which is applied to make sure Service
        Provider's Agents will complete their tasks on time, or they will get a
        penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        • OLA (Operational Service Agreement) is the internal agreement of a
        team, which is applied to make sure that team will complete the task on
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the main designer working on this new feature in early Fall 2021
        with a scum team of product owner, business analyst, developers, and
        quality controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Merchant is the CRM that belongs to Client360 - the Call Center
        Application.)
      </p>

        alt="The chart shows the product Chuong works on amongst other products."
      />
      <!-- Purpose -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Purpose</h3>
      <!-- Context -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">1. Context</h5>
      <p>
        Assume that one day, the Manager of KFC calls Bank of America to inquire
        about the current transaction because something appears to be incorrect.
        Because Bank of America outsourced the call center service, all calls
        will be received and answered by call center agents via Client360.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the agent answers the phone, the KFC manager describes the nature
        of the call and requests assistance. The agent will enter the call
        information into the Merchant CRM and create an inquiry. When the
        inquiry is successfully created, it will be handled by a specific team.
      </p>
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-slaola-context.webp"
        alt="Illustration shows the context when to use the Merchant CRM."
      />
      <!-- Problem -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">2. Problem</h5>
      <p>
        There are probably thousands of inquiries in the CRM, and not all of
        them are prioritized the same way. Some are urgent and must be resolved
        immediately, while others can wait. However, the agent sometimes
        overlooks this, which has an impact on the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the issue here is how to ensure that the Agent is always aware of
        resolving inquiries in order of priority, from most to least urgent
      </p>
      <!-- Goal -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">3. Goal</h5>
      <p>
        User: Complete inquiries in order of priority, from most to least urgent
        without missing or delay.
      </p>
      <p>Business: Improve service quality.</p>
      <p>
        Product: Enhance product quality by introducing a new and useful
        feature.
      </p>
      <!-- Design process -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Design process</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Gathered business requirements from the Product
        Owner and ask questions to learn more about what the business wants,
        what the problem is, and so on.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Conducted secondary research.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Created a low-fidelity wireframe and present it
        to the Internal Design team, POs, and Client for feedback. This step is
        repeated several times until the client's requirements are met and the
        entire flow is approved.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Created high-fidelity mockups and hand them off
        to the scrum team.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Followed up with the scrum team and support
        them in case any problem happen.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Conducted UI testing after the feature has been
        deployed.

        alt="SLA OLA feature is shown on the interface of the Merchant CRM."
      />
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        • Devoted a significant amount of time and effort to discussing and
        clarifying raw requirements with the PO/BA team.
        <br />
        • Required to understand complex business logic before and during
        designing phase.
      </p>

      <!-- Result -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Result</h3>
      <p>
        We received positive feedback from the business side, which mentioned
        that the design is clear and easy to notice when working on the task.
        That boosts the user's confidence because they know there is a tool that
        can help them with their work.
