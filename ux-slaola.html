              The SLA/OLA feature is part of a digital product called Merchant,
              one of several tools within an ecosystem designed for call
              centres. This feature was developed to help call centre agents
              manage their tasks more effectively. It displays the remaining
              time directly on the interface, showing both the time agreed upon
              internally to resolve each inquiry and the time agents have left
              to meet those expectations for callers representing merchants. The
              project was delivered in collaboration with a cross-functional
              team, including a product owner, developers, and quality assurance
              specialists.

      <!-- Intro -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        During my time at
        <a class="hyperlink-normal" href="https://aperia.com" target="_blank"
          >Aperia</a
        >, I worked as a UX Designer on a digital product called Merchant.
        Merchant is one of the applications within a call centre ecosystem
        called Client360. In the diagram below, I’ve illustrated how Merchant
        fits into the Client360 ecosystem.
      </p>

        src="img/ux-sla-ola-products.webp"
        alt="The chart shows the product Chuong works on amongst other products."
      />

      <!-- Context -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Context</h3>
      <p>
        Assume that one day, the Manager of KFC calls Bank of America to inquire
        about the current transaction because something appears to be incorrect.
        Because Bank of America outsourced the call center service, all calls
        will be received and answered by call center agents via Client360.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the agent answers the phone, the KFC manager describes the nature
        of the call and requests assistance. The agent will enter the call
        information into the Merchant CRM and create an inquiry. When the
        inquiry is successfully created, it will be handled by a specific team.
      </p>

      />
      <!-- Problem -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Each call centre agent receives up to 50 inquiries per day, contributing
        to hundreds of unresolved cases stored in the Merchant CRM. These
        inquiries vary in priority. Some are urgent and require immediate
        attention, while others can be addressed later. However, agents
        sometimes overlook these distinctions, leading to delays that can
        negatively impact business performance.
      </p>
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-sla-ola-problem.webp"
        alt="The chart shows the product Chuong works on amongst other products."
      />
      <!-- Goal -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The goal was to ensure that agents consistently resolve inquiries based
        on priority, starting with the most urgent. To address this, I
        collaborated closely with the product owner after receiving the problem
        statement from our client. Together, we explored possible solutions
        through extensive desk research and discussions. Ultimately, we decided
        to implement an SLA and OLA feature, similar to those used in other
        products on the market, to address the problem.
      </p>
      <p>But, what are SLA and OLA?</p>
      <p>
        • SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a formal agreement between the client
        (Merchant) and the service provider. It ensures that the provider's
        agents complete their tasks within a specified timeframe. If they fail
        to do so, they may face penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        • OLA (Operational Level Agreement) is an internal agreement within a
        team. It defines the expected timeframes for completing tasks to support
        the commitments made in the SLA.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        User: Complete inquiries in order of priority, from most to least urgent
        without missing or delay.
      </p>
      <p>Business: Improve service quality.</p>
      <p>
        Product: Enhance product quality by introducing a new and useful
        feature.
      </p> -->
      <!-- Design process -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">So, what did I do exactly?</h3>
      <p>
        To solve the problem, I first worked closely with the Product Owner to
        clarify the client's ambiguous requirements. We aligned on the goals and
        defined what success would look like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I conducted secondary research to understand how other products in
        the market handled similar challenges, using those insights to guide our
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the direction was clear, I sketched out low-fidelity wireframes to
        visualize the SLA/OLA feature and presented them to stakeholders for
        feedback. This helped us align early and make informed design decisions.
      </p>
      <!-- Wireframe -->
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-sla-ola-wireframe.webp"
        alt="SLA OLA feature is shown on the interface of the Merchant CRM."
      />
      <!-- Wireframe image description -->
      <p>
        <i
          >Image 1: The wireframe above shows the concept I designed based on
          discussions with the Product Owner and client feedback.</i
        >
      </p>
      <!-- Wireframe ends -->
      <p>
        I then designed the final high-fidelity mockups, integrating the SLA/OLA
        feature directly into the Merchant CRM interface to help agents
        prioritize their tasks more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        After handing off the designs to the scrum team, I stayed involved
        throughout the development process by following up regularly and
        offering support whenever the team encountered questions or blockers.
      </p>
      <!-- Mockups -->
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-slaola-final-design.webp"
        alt="SLA OLA feature is shown on the interface of the Merchant CRM."
      />
      <!-- Mockups image description -->
      <p>
        <i
          >Image 2: The final design of the SLA/OLA feature was integrated and
          visualized within the Merchant CRM interface.</i
        >
      </p>
      <!-- Mockup ends -->
      <!-- Result -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Result</h3>
      <p>
        The client gave positive feedback on the feature, saying the design was
        clear and easy to spot while working on tasks. It also helped boost the
        agents’ confidence because they knew they had a tool to support them in
        managing their workload.
      </p>
      <!-- Challenges and Limitations -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Challenges and Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main challenges I faced was interpreting and clarifying
        ambiguous requirements from the client. The initial problem statement
        lacked detail, so I worked closely with the Product Owner to dig deeper
        and ensure we were solving the right problem. Another key challenge was
        defining clear logic for the SLA/OLA feature. Since the feature impacted
        how agents prioritized tasks, it was crucial to make sure the behavior
        was well-defined and aligned with business expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major limitation of the project was that we were unable to gather
        direct user feedback on the SLA/OLA feature. Due to time and access
        constraints, we had to rely on stakeholder insights and secondary
        research to guide our design decisions.
