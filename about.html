          <strong>Chuong</strong> is my name, and I recently realized it's
          pretty tough for non-Vietnamese people to pronounce correctly. I’ve
          thought about adopting an English name, but sometimes it just
          doesn’t...feel like me. Interestingly, like most Vietnamese kids, I
          have a nickname given by my beloved grandma—Gon. If you're into anime,
          you might recognize it from

        <!---------- MOM, I DON'T WANT TO BE A DOCTOR ---------->
        <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Mom, I don't want to be a doctor!</h3>
        <p>
          Before becoming a UX Designer, my (Asian) mom always wanted me to
          follow our family tradition and become a doctor. But becoming a doctor
          was never what I wanted to be. Moreover, securing a spot in medical
          school wasn’t easy at all. Reaching the age of 18, I applied to UEH
          University (Flexing warning: one of the top universities in Vietnam)
          and majored in International Business—wishfully thinking I would
          travel the world and enjoy the journey (without any real intention of
          doing business).
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a creative child. I loved drawing and was pretty good at it. At
          12 years old, I started learning how to create videos using my dad's
          compact camera and some cracked video-editing software. Then, I began
          experimenting with (also cracked) Photoshop to make it look like I was
          traveling around the world in pictures. Although I later went to
          Business School, I still recognized my passion for creative work. In
          my second year, I enrolled in a few design courses to pursue that
          passion and joined some university clubs to practice my skills. In
          2018, I landed my first freelance job as a Graphic Designer, and I
          still remember how happy and proud I was.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Designer—that's what I want to be</h3>
        <p>
          Later, I shifted my focus from Graphic Design to UX Design because I
          fell madly in love with how rational and complex it was. In early
          2019, I taught myself UX Design by reading books and learning from
          online sources. In September 2019, just two months after graduating, I
          secured my first UX Design job at Swag Soft Holdings.

        <!---------- I WANT TO BE MORE THAN JUST A DESIGNER ---------->
        <h3 class="subpage-title-section">
          Also, I want to be more than just a designer
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a member of the "human beings", I also have passions. I practice
          photography, play guitar and spend time learning French every day.
          More than anything, I chose to leave my home and family behind to fly
          all the way to Canada to follow my own dream in 2023, hopefully to
          have a better future and a better-self.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, I’m too focused on reaching my dreams that I forget I’m an
          immortal human too—I need to live life, not just survive. I probably
          wouldn’t have made it through the sorrowful Canadian winter without my
          adventurous friend,

            >Amaan</a
          >, who pulled me outside to practice skating. That reminded me of the
          importance of self-cultivation—of nurturing the body, heart, and
          mind—to be able to pursue my passions and dreams in the long run.

          ...That was what my grandma said when I told her I wouldn’t be able to
          be with anyone in this life, because I know how strict I am with
          myself and with others. Of course, the English version only partly
          captures the meaning in Vietnamese—after all, “traduire, c’est trahir”
          (to translate is to betray). Anyways, her words have stuck in my head
          ever since, and they’ve become a part of who I am today. Probably
          thanks to that, I’ve built many great relationships with others.

          Let me end this self-pitch with my 2025 resolutions:<i>
            "Challenge myself to do something uncomfortable every day"</i
          >
          and
          <i>"have the courage to ask for what I want".</i> I hope you feel like
          you know me a little bit now, but just so you know—I’m much more
          interesting than what I’ve just told you. I love tea—Both herbal and
