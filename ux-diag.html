      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        A few years ago, <strong>Diag Pro</strong> was a tool that doctors
        collaborating with Diag used to view patients' test results only. Over
        time, due to real needs of doctors, Diag has been introducing more
        features. Until now, doctors can:
        <br />
        • Give test orders (or prescriptions) to patients online.
        <br />
        • View patient results online.
        <br />
        • Check the test library when consulting patients online.
        <br />
        • View created orders (prescriptions) of every month online.
      </p>

      />
      <!-- The problem -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        In March 2023, the product owner reviewed data from Mix Panel and made
        an interesting discovery:
        <i
          >"70% of doctors created their first digital test order for a patient
          one month after being onboarded by the sales team of Diag. However, at
          that time, the doctors barely remembered how to do so."- whispered by
          the product owner.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With this insight in mind, the Customer Success team met with doctors to
        learn more about their problems and needs. During these meetings,
        doctors expressed their concerns:
        <i>
          “We are unsure of how to create new orders for patients and use other
          features. We have no time to explore these features because we are
          always busy with patients. Therefore, we prefer to give test orders on
          paper instead.”
        </i>
      </p>
      <!-- Goal -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Goal</h3>
      Based on these insights, the product team has decided to improve the
      website's user experience for doctors who use the website infrequently or
      for the first time. The following are the specific goals:
      <p>
        For product:
        <br />
        • Making the homepage more intuitive and interesting for doctors when
        they log in for the first time so that they can easily use any function
        without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Business:
        <br />
        • Attracting more doctors to join Diag by improving the service and
        tool.
        <br />
        • Encouraging more doctors to use the website instead of handwritten
        methods.
      </p>

      <!-- Design process -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Design process</h3>
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">1. Design process</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Discussed with Product team to understand the
        problem.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Determined user user personas.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Ideated and conducting the secondary research.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Created lo-fi wireframes, presenting them to
        the entire product team, and gathering feedback.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Created mockups and handing them off to the
        Scrum team. Meanwhile, following up and troubleshooting any abrupt
        problems.
        <br />
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Reviewed the UI after the feature has been
        deployed.
      </p>
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">2. Final Design</h5>
      <p>Before:</p>
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-diag-home-old.webp"
        alt="Diag's Home page before redesigning"
      />
      <p>After:</p>
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/ux-diag-home-new.webp"
        alt="Diag's Home page after redesigning"
      />

      <!-- Result -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">Result</h3>
      <p>
        The recent design improvements have garnered positive feedback from both
        the internal and external members of the product team.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to ensure continued success, it is essential to maintain close
        communication with doctors and receive their valuable feedbacks. By
        actively listening to their insights and incorporating their
        suggestions, we can further enhance the design to better meet their
        needs and expectations. Continuous improvement is key to delivering an
        exceptional user experience for our product.
