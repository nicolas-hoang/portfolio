              The City of Ottawa has raised concerns about the low participation
              of youth in its recreational programs. To investigate this issue,
              this study explored the barriers preventing youth aged 18–25 in
              five priority Ottawa neighbourhoods from engaging with city-run
              recreation programs. Our findings reveal three primary challenges:
              a lack of accessible and affordable recreational spaces, a lack of
              flexibility in programming, and ineffective communication
              strategies. In response, this research introduces a three-phase
              intervention aimed at improving engagement. It includes immediate
              tools to support program design and outreach, collaborative
              strategies to involve youth in shaping services, and a long-term
              vision to create dedicated youth hubs that foster connection and
              belonging. The project was conducted collaboratively by

      <!-- Why do we start this project -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">1. Why do we start this project?</h3>
      <p>
        In September 2024, Brent McQueen, Molly Cook, and Carlos Ramos from the
        Recreation, Cultural and Facility Services (RCFS) of the City of Ottawa
        expressed concerns about the youth who are not actively participating in
        recreational activities provided by the city in their community centres.
      </p>
      <p>
        This research focuses on youth in five urban neighbourhoods of Ottawa:
        Britannia, Carlington, Lower Town, Overbrook, and Sandy Hill. These
        neighbourhoods are considered high priority because the gap between
        youth and recreation programs is larger than in other neighbourhoods in
        the urban areas according to our client. According to Neighbourhood
        Maps, post-secondary institutions are either located within or near the
        five targeted neighbourhoods. Additionally, these areas host a
        significant number of newcomers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This study focuses on youth aged 18 to 25, regardless of their enrolment
        status in a post-secondary institution. This age range is defined by two
        criteria: it aligns with the typical age of youth attending
        post-secondary institutions, and it reflects the age groupings used by
        the City of Ottawa for organizing its programs.
      </p>
      <!-- Goals and objectives -->
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">What's next...</h5>
      <p>
        A follow-up literature review highlighted the relationship between
        newcomers to Canada and recreation spaces/programs. For instance, while
        many newcomers to Canada are eager to participate in sports and physical
        activities, they often encounter unique challenges, particularly with
        time and cost. This is especially true during their first few years when
        their focus is usually on securing a job, finding housing, and settling
        into their new environment (ParticipACTION, 2022). Additionally,
        Charles-Rodriguez & Larouche (2024) found that immigrants participated
        in fewer types of outdoor recreation activities than Canadian-born
        individuals. The study also showed that immigrants who did more outdoor
        recreation activities felt a stronger sense of belonging and were more
        satisfied with life in Canada. However, the authors warned that
        recreation programs should not be one-size-fits-all, as some immigrants
        may feel nostalgic, disconnected, or uprooted.
      </p>
      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">Research goals and objectives</h5>
      <p>
        The goal of this study is to examine the factors that discourage youth
        aged 18 to 25 from enrolling in municipal recreation programs.
        Additionally, it will assess how the City of Ottawa engages with youth
        and communicates relevant program information effectively. Finally, the
        study will explore the impact of recreation programs on youth
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing on the research outlined above, the research question to be
        investigated is:
        <b
          ><i
            >What factors facilitate an interactive and social experience
            amongst urban youth?</i
          ></b
        >
      </p>
      <p>In doing so, the research objectives are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Explore if the current communication channels resonate with
          post-secondary youth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand what youth are looking for when it comes to organized
          recreation/leisure activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explore the values youth desire from recreational activities to help
          positively impact their lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand the extent to which financial barriers influence youth
          participation in recreational activities.
        </li>
        <li>Understand how leisure activities fall into youths' lifestyles.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Methods and participants -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">2. Research Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        A mixed-methods approach was used to collect both qualitative and
        quantitative data from youth aged 18 to 25 residing in urban Ottawa. The
        study was divided into three phases to obtain the data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Phase 1:</b> A screener survey</li>
        <li>
          <b>Phase 2:</b> Semi-structured interviews with youth participants and
          Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Phase 3:</b> Design validation interviews with youth and SMEs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Participants -->
      <p>
        Descriptive statistical methods were used to identify key trends and
        patterns from quantitative data. Qualitative data were thematically
        coded and visually organised on Miro to analyze and identify themes and
        insights.
      </p>

      <!-- Design process -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">3. Findings</h3>

        src="img/research-incavico-stats.webp"
        alt="research stats"
      />
      <p>
        Through our research, which included 72 surveys and 10 participant
        interviews, along with 8 SME additional interviews, we identified key
        pain points experienced by our users. This helped us gain a better
        understanding of how recreation fits into their lives. By using the
        persona outlined below, we gained valuable insights into their needs and
        were able to empathize more deeply with their experiences.
      </p>

      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">
        Factors hinder youth's participation
      </h5>
      <p>
        Our findings revealed three major gaps between the city and its youth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Social Spaces:</b> Many recreational spaces are not easily
          accessible or budget-friendly, making participation difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Flexibility:</b> Youth often have unpredictable schedules due to
          school and work. Programs that lack flexibility create barriers to
          participation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Awareness:</b> There is limited awareness of available programs.
          Youth mainly rely on social media and word-of-mouth, yet current
          outreach strategies don’t effectively use these channels.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Intervention -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">4. Intervention</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the insights and from our system map analysis, we identified
        that the most immediate and effective solution lies in reimagining the
        role of community centers—the key touchpoints between youth and the
        city’s recreational services. Our research highlighted the dedication
        and enthusiasm of community center staff, revealing a powerful
        opportunity to support and empower them in creating more engaging,
        youth-focused experiences.

      <h5 class="subpage-title-section">
        A Scalable Three-Phase Intervention Framework
      </h5>
      <p>
        Our proposed solution is a scalable, three-phase approach designed for
        long-term impact. It empowers community centers to better engage youth
        through co-creation, active participation, and the cultivation of a
        strong sense of belonging. Each phase builds on the previous to ensure
        sustainable growth and deeper connections between youth and the city’s
        recreational spaces—both physical and digital. The journey begins by
        raising awareness and boosting initial participation and culminates in
        the creation of a hybrid community hub that serves as a true Third
        Place: a welcoming environment beyond school and work where young people
        can connect, engage, and thrive.
      </p>
      <p class="subpage-title-section">
        The three phases of the solution are described below:
      </p>
      <!-- 3-phase intervention -->
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/research-incavico-scalable-intervention.webp"
        alt="3-phrase intervention"
      />
      <!-- Phase 1 -->
      <p><b>Phase 1: Awareness & Co-Creation</b></p>
      <p>
        The first phase begins with the implementation of a practical and
        adaptable Youth Engagement Toolkit, designed to equip community centers
        with the tools they need to meaningfully connect with youth and
        co-create relevant recreational offerings. The toolkit includes three
        core components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scheduling & Planning Guide: A customizable planning calendar that
          helps each facility align staff efforts and organize seasonal
          programming activities efficiently and strategically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Co-Creation Guide: A step-by-step guide for designing and facilitating
          co-creation workshops with youth, focusing on inclusive practices,
          meaningful participation, and collaborative decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engagement Guide: This section outlines how to design compelling
          campaigns, select the right communication channels, and build
          partnerships to effectively promote the new youth-driven programs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This phase allows each community center to adapt the toolkit to its
        specific context, creating a structure that encourages active youth
        participation in shaping the seasonal recreational offerings tailored to
        their needs and preferences.
      </p>
      <!-- toolkit -->
      <img
        class="subpage-image"
        src="img/research-incavico-toolkit.webp"
        alt="Incavico Research Study Poster"
      />
      <!-- Phase 2 -->
      <p><b>Phase 2: Strengthening Participation</b></p>
      <p>
        As co-creation initiatives gain momentum, the youth engagement group
        grows stronger, inviting more young people to get involved. In this
        phase, the scope of collaboration expands beyond programming. Youth
        begin to contribute ideas for improvements to infrastructure, equipment,
        virtual platforms, and communication strategies within their community
        centres.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a deeper sense of ownership and social connection, where
        youth not only participate in programs but also influence the direction
        of their development. This inclusive and responsive approach encourages
        older youth (18–25) to serve as role models and catalysts for engaging
        younger audiences, fostering an intergenerational culture of
        participation and empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, this phase emphasizes upgrading the digital platform,
        ensuring that program information is accessible, relevant, and aligned
        with how youth prefer to discover and engage with recreational
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <!-- Phase 3 -->
      <p><b>Phase 3: Establishing the Youth Hub</b></p>
      <p>
        The final phase establishes a true “Third Place” for youth in Ottawa—a
        space that exists beyond home and school/work, where young people feel
        welcomed, seen, and connected. Each community center becomes a
        recognizable spot in the city where youth feel a strong sense of
        belonging, supported by a physical environment shaped by their input.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience is enhanced by a dedicated digital space on the city’s
        recreation platform, where youth can create groups, share stories,
        organize activities, and showcase their community impact. It becomes
        more than a place to sign up for programs—it’s a living hub of
        connection, creativity, and community that supports ongoing engagement
        and visibility for youth voices.

      <!-- Limitations -->
      <h3 class="subpage-title-section">5. Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        The main constraint within this research was the researchers' inability
        to conduct interviews with participants who took part in the City of
        Ottawa recreational programs. Advisors who have experience with the City
        of Ottawa recreational programs could supply beneficial guidance about
        program-specific obstacles and thus expand research depth. The brief
        collection period and narrow scope of the study limited researchers from
        conducting an extensive analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future researchers should study how web interface design and workflow
        functionality affect user engagement and experience. Research into
        "third places" as informal public spaces away from home and work could
        help understand how to build community ties and improve urban social
        health. Future research should concentrate on studying these regions

      <p>
        This research study was my first experience conducting an end-to-end
        research process, and it provided a clear understanding of how to move
        from vague problem areas to actionable design solutions. I learned how
        to plan a research study in alignment with Research and Ethics Board
        (REB) guidelines, ensuring ethical and responsible practices throughout.
        I gained experience conducting both surveys and interviews, engaging not
        only with participants but also with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to
        collect diverse and meaningful data. Additionally, I developed skills in
        scheduling and coordinating interviews efficiently, which contributed to
        a smooth data collection process. Throughout the project, I regularly
        presented research progress, findings, and proposed solutions to
        clients, which helped build confidence in sharing insights clearly and
        persuasively. Most importantly, I learned how to design service design
        interventions based on research insights to effectively address complex
        problems.
